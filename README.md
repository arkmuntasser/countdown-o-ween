# Countdown-o-ween

You know that scene from The Nightmare Before Christmas where the Mayor says there's only 365 days until the next Halloween and the werewolf dude corrects him by yelling, "364!!!"? You know, this scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J03FuItYRvs

Well people use it as a meme to countdown until Halloween on social media. I've made a website that makes those meme's for easy use.

So now there's a website based on a meme based on a scene from The Nightmare Before Christmas and now the internet is complete.

You're welcome.
